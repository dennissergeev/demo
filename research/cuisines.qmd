Exoplanet models are complex pieces of software that often require significant computational resources.
I collaborate with researchers around the world to systematically compare and benchmark different models, with the ultimate goal to get more robust and reproducible modelling results.
This is done via so-called model intercomparison projects (MIPs).
While there is a long history of MIPs in the Earth climate community, a more organised effort to do this for exoplanets has begun thanks to [CUISINES](https://nexss.info/cuisines), an international model intercomparison framework.
The pilot project of CUISINES was the TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI), which focused on scenarios for a potentially habitable climate on an Earth-size exoplanet TRAPPIST-1e, a primary target for atmospheric characterisation.
THAI resulted in three major publications: (1) 'dry planet' simulations[@Turbet22_thai], (2) 'aqua-planet' simulations[@Sergeev22_thai] and (3) atmosphere detectability[@Fauchez22_thai].
Following the TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison workshop in 2020, we published a review[@Fauchez21_workshop] of exoplanet climate models and parameterizations of the atmospheric processes on terrestrial exoplanets, with a discussion on the recent model advancements and limitations, as well as directions for future model development.

Since THAI, ten more exoplanet MIPs for a variety of model types and exoplanet targets have started.
I am contributing to several CUISINES MIPs such as those for 3D sub-Neptune climate models [@Christie22_camembert], 1D radiative transfer models[@Villanueva24_modeling], 3D hot Jupiter climate models and others.
Together with Thomas Fauchez at NASA, I am a co-chair of CUISINES (since 2024).
