Colored beams connect each planet to a corresponding graph displaying a transmission spectrum in orange, green, red, and blue."}

Exoplanet models are complex pieces of software that often require significant computational resources.
I collaborate with researchers around the world to systematically compare and benchmark different models, with the ultimate goal to get more robust and reproducible modelling results.

I am a co-chair of the international model intercomparison framework called [CUISINES](https://nexss.info/cuisines).

Each badge displays a food item and project name such as MOCHA, FILLET, SAMOSA, CREME, THAI, CAMEMBERT, COD ACCRA, PIE, RISOTTO, and MALBEC. The central badge reads CUISINES and Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparison: Needed for Exoplanet Studies."}
