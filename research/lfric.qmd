I am leading the adaptation of LFRic, [the Met Office's next-generation model](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/next-gen-modelling-systems), to the atmospheres of exoplanets and solar system planets (at the moment focusing on Mars & ice giants).

In my 2023 study[@Sergeev23_simulations], I showed that LFRic can reproduce a number of idealised climate scenarios for terrestrial exoplanets such as the Held-Suarez-like temperature forcing cases and the [THAI](https://nexss.info/cuisines/thai-mip/) benchmarks.
I then focused on the impact of convection on the planetary climate in a global stretched-mesh simulation[@Sergeev24_impact].
This work was the first application of a stretched-mesh global model to exoplanets and has a great potential for studying convection at a reduced computational cost.

Currently, I am working on adapting LFRic to hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, as well as the solar system ice giants.
